## Assignment

### NLM implementation

* Implement 3 different versions of NLM
* Compare the methods on simulated noisy images
* Create noisy images by adding Gaussian noise of standard deviations 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25
* Use PSNR as similarity metric
* Brief description of each method
* Experimental results
* Analysis
* Conclusion
